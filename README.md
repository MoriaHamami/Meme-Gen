	<h1>Meme-Gen</h1>
</div>

An awesome Meme Generator, made pixel-perfect according to a given UI design using pure CSS (no use of CSS Libraries or jQuery), which works great on both desktop and mobile. [Check it out here](https://moriahamami.github.io/Meme-Gen/ "Website link")!

The app has two main UI areas: Image-Gallery and Meme-Editor. Once the user selects an image on the Image-Gallery, the image is presented on the Meme-Editor, where the user can edit and create a meme, and once ready - download it. 
** The app supports viewing various aspect-ratio images, with a consistent, clean design.

## Image-Gallery Functionality
- Search images by typing in search-field or by selecting keywords (each word size is determined by the popularity of the keyword search - so
each click on a keyword makes that keyword bigger).
- The user can upload and edit images from his computer.
